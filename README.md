# Movie web-app using MERN!

## Motivation:
I've always wanted to learn more about the MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJs, NodeJs) stack, so I started this project shortly after I built my website (May 2020). Development on this project has slowed down a little, but I will look to develop this project further. Currently I am looking to expand on the functionality of this project by allowing users to add employees into the database.

## Usage
To run this project, you will need two command prompts on Windows. First, clone the repository. For the first command line:
```
cd server
nodemon index.js ## Starts the server on port 3000
```

For the second command line:
```
cd client
npm install
npm start ## Runs on port 3000, but due to us running the server instance on port 3000, we will instead tap "Y" to running it on port 3001.
```


## To be built features:
Adding a User database, and location database to test knowledge/understanding of concept. TBD.
Fix the styling to make it look better.
